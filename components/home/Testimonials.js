We have never had such a highly competent, professional and reliable partner. In addition to his technical expertise, Ilyas offers absolutely great customer communication. He implements projects almost faster than we can write the briefing. The quality of his work is exceptional. In summary, he can be described as Highly Professional. We have good comparisons and are absolutely thrilled with Ilyas. We look forward to many more projects with him. Thank you for everything Ilyas and keep up the good work! :) Many greetings from Germany",

I needed some additional, bespoke coding for a Shopify theme in order to make the images work better on mobile devices. The seller integrated a seamless new function within my theme customizer that allows me to upload separate images for desktop and mobile, with all the controls I need to adjust how the images display. 'Under the hood' in my theme customizer, his work sits perfectly alongside the other controls designed by Shopify. Excellent to deal with, work delivered above my expectations and on schedule.",
